Begin to learn game programming
This seperates to three part.
First is OpenGL. Project 1
1.1.1 This contains How to set up the OpenGL programming environment
1.1.2 Project1 is a task and solution to draws a 3D object from obj file by ASSIMP , specify a camera,write a vertex shader and a fragment shader and when user press the up and down arrow key, the object should be rotated around its center along the X axis
Project2. This project draws a 3D object from obj file by ASSIMP, attaches a texture image, specify a camera,write a vertex shader and a fragment shader, two directional lights
1.2 This project 
Second is Vulkan. Project 3
2.1This contains How to set up the Vulkan programming environment and  https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/
2.2 This draws the 3D object from obj file by ASSIMP,write a vertex shader, a fragment shader and one light source. The lighting must be implemented in the fragment shader.one light source. 
Last is Direct3D 12\OpenCL Project 4
3.1This contains How to set up the Vulkan programming environment https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn899120(v=vs.85).aspx
3.2 This project reads a color image, convert it to a grayscale image, and save the grayscale image to a file by gFreeImage
